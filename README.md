## Purpose
I want to learn more about frontend, and specifically next. And how to build clean applications as fast as possible, without looking away from knowlage and functionallity.

## Vision
First of is to keep a clean planning, as well as document, structure. I will keep too the guidelines I set up for myself, and commit often. It will also be a practis in momentum, as I will build several template projects in here. 

So for an initial vision:

Three template applications, all built in Next.js:

- Boilerplate for a blog website.
- Boilerplate for an online store.
- Boilerplate for an admin dashboard.

If I pull this off good, ill also have solid documentation, journaling as well as notes on everything I will learn.
