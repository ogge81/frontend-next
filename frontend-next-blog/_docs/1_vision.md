# Vision

## What are you building?
I am building 3 frontend templates, for furture use. 

## Why are you building it?
I need to learn more on both frontend, and how to start and finnish project more efficiant. But most of all will these templates come in use, in future plans.

## What does 'done' look like?
Well documented plan and worklog. Three finnished templates, with minimalistik design but awsome functionallity. Also, alot of notes about what im learning.

## What will you 'not' do in this project?
I will not stop taking notes, and logging my progress. I wont build anything at all, that is out of scope.
