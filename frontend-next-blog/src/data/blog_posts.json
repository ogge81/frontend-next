I wanted to create a blog website where users could write, edit, and share their thoughts. In this blog post, I'll describe how I built it, the challenges I faced, and the lessons I learned.\n\n\n## Why I Chose the MERN Stack\n\n- The MERN stack is widely used for building modern web applications. Here’s why I chose it:\n\n- MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible JSON-like format.\n\n- Express.js: A minimal and powerful backend framework for Node.js.\n\n- React.js: A fast and efficient frontend library for building interactive UI.\n\n- Node.js: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server.","status":"PUBLISHED","createdAt":"2026-02-21T08:00:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2026-03-01T09:48:42.362Z","publishedAt":"2026-02-21T09:00:00.000Z"},{"id":3,"title":"Backend vs No Backend Debate","slug":"backend-vs-no-backend-debate","excerpt":"Should LifeControl start as static or full stack?","content_md":"# Backend vs Static\n\nTempted to go static.\n\nBut:\n- I want drafts\n- I want auth\n- I want flexibility\n\nSo backend it is.\n\n## Answer\n\n**Fullstack ofcurse!**","status":"PUBLISHED","createdAt":"2026-02-22T08:00:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2026-03-01T09:08:58.913Z","publishedAt":"2026-02-22T09:00:00.000Z"},{"id":4,"title":"Postgres Running in Docker","slug":"postgres-running-in-docker","excerpt":"First successful container on the VPS.","content_md":"# Postgres in Docker\n\nUsed docker-compose.\n\n```bash\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\nIt worked.
